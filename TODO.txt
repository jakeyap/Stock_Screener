0. Regex editor to grab data from Morningstar.
    Download the financial statements first (optional)
    Download the prices for USA stocks
    Download the prices for SG stocks
    Regex the following
        year
        Net income
        EPS
        BVPS
        FCFPS
        Dividends
        Shares count
        
        As a % of book value,
        Total equity
        ST debt
        LT debt
        Year closing share price
        When data is found, plot the whole lot out for sanity checking

1. Are earnings predictable? Consistent or growing?   
    Partly done. Draw regression lines and check for 50% tolerance
    Need to check slope also

2. Determine initial rate of return. 
    EPS / price

3. Determine per share earnings growth rate. 
    Done using regression. 
    Now need to use cash flow method (EPS - dividends, compound using ROE)
    
4. Determine value of company relative to gov bonds
    

5. Determine the best/worst cases stock price using historical PE
    

6. Determine annual return compounding rate
    Use the geometric series formula to figure out growth rate
        
7. Is the company in serious debt? 
    ( LTDebt + STDebt ) / Equity

20180813:   To create sample data for step 0 first. Then run steps 1 to 8. 
20180814:   Done for YZJ and Keppel. 
TODO:
    Include DBS and Visa. Copy over proper headers in the data
    Change

Here is the plan. Conceptually, here's what I want to do
1. Grab data from MS into a CSV file.
2. Extract the strings of what to plot
3. Extract the numbers to plot
4. Plot the financials
5. Visually inspect the numbers and decide on sensible ones
6. Generate predicted numbers
7. Do a DCF to calculate present value


1. 
INPUT: MS URL of company financials, company name and year
OUTPUT: CSV file dumped into folder called company name + year

2.
INPUT: CSV file and company name + year
OUTPUT: list of strings

3. 
INPUT: CSV file and company name + year
OUTPUT: list of lists of financials

4.
INPUT: list of strings and list of (lists of financials)
OUTPUT: None. Prints plots, save to folder

5.
INPUT: MANUAL step. Observe plots and guess numbers
OUTPUT: List of numbers. (Dividend tax, PE, ROE, payout ratio, discount rate)

6.
INPUT: List of guessed numbers, list of strings, list of (list of financials)
OUTPUT: Present value

I have difficulty trying to rip out Morningstar PE ratios data.
Therefore, let's just assume the data has been formatted in a way I want.
To not get stuck in steps 1-3, create a test file to generate hardcoded test data first
Proceed with step 4 onwards with the fake data

Fake data needed.
Year
ROE
FCF
EPS
Dividends
Payout ratio
BVPS
number of shares
PE ratio

DONE WITH GENERATING FAKE DATA (generate_test_data.py)
Next: Create nice plots overlaying one another in the window

Used dictionaries to store the data instead of lists. More portable.

Done extracting data from a csv
Done generating some sample fake data
Done doing the cash flow projections
