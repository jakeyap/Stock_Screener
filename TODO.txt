0. Regex editor to grab data from Morningstar.
    Download the financial statements first (optional)
    Download the prices for USA stocks
    Download the prices for SG stocks
    Regex the following
        year
        Net income
        EPS
        BVPS
        FCFPS
        Dividends
        Shares count
        
        As a % of book value,
        Total equity
        ST debt
        LT debt
        Year closing share price
        When data is found, plot the whole lot out for sanity checking

1. Are earnings predictable? Consistent or growing?   
    Partly done. Draw regression lines and check for 50% tolerance
    Need to check slope also

2. Determine initial rate of return. 
    EPS / price

3. Determine per share earnings growth rate. 
    Now need to use cash flow method (EPS - dividends, compound using ROE)
    
4. Determine value of company relative to gov bonds    

5. Determine the best/worst cases stock price using historical PE    

6. Determine annual return compounding rate
    Use the geometric series formula to figure out growth rate
        
7. Is the company in serious debt? 
    ( LTDebt + STDebt ) / Equity

======================
2019 July 8th
Used dictionaries to store the data instead of lists. More portable.
Done extracting data from a csv
Done generating some sample fake data
Done doing the cash flow projections
======================
2019 July 9th
Done creating the basic analysis tool.
Can plug in DCF discount rate, estimates of future ROE and PE, and estimate present value
Next steps
1. automate the data extraction process from morningstar csv spreadsheets
2. automate selection of the ROE and PE figure by taking 1SD below mean
3. sweep the ROE, PE, make discount rate as a parameter
   make family of 3D plots to see what returns to expect
