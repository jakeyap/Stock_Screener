Done the automatic ROE, PE sweeps
Included readme as well as an algorithm description

Done creating the basic analysis tool.
Can plug in DCF discount rate, estimates of future ROE and PE, and estimate present value

Next steps
1. automate the data extraction process from morningstar csv spreadsheets
2. automate selection of the ROE and PE figure by taking 1SD below mean
3. sweep the ROE, PE, make discount rate as a parameter
   make family of 3D plots to see what returns to expect

So far, the steps to grab raw data is manual download from Morningstar
Copy the row/cols manually into a clean format.

Used dictionaries to store the data instead of lists. More portable.
Done extracting data from a csv
Done generating some sample fake data
Done doing the cash flow projections

Morningstar's api is no longer working. Change the approach to manual.
Changed the approach so far. Not doing regression on earnings anymore.
Instead, plot past data of 
   EPS        ROE
   PE_ratio   PB_ratio
   free cash flow per share (fcfps)
   dividend   numberofshares
   payout_ratio

This project is for implementing a stock analysis tool.

The book titled Buffetology by Mary Buffet describes an algorithm.
    1. Check if earnings predictable. Consistent or growing.
    2. Determine initial rate of return from the PE ratio
    3. Determine per share earnings growth rate
    4. Determine value of company relative to gov bonds
    5. Determine the best/worst cases stock price using historical PE
    6. Determine annual return compounding rate
    7. Is the company in serious debt? ( LTDebt + STDebt ) / Equity
    
We will do regression on total earnings & EPS. Will predict earnings 10Y from now
