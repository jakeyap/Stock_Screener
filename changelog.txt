Using the historical ROE averages, use it to estimate future book value.
1. Estimate EPS_1 = (avg ROE) x bookvalue_0
2. Estimate dividends_1 = EPS_1 x (avg payout_ratio)
3. Estimate bookvalue_1 = (EPS_1 - div_1) + bookvalue_0
4. Estimate stockprice_1 = EPS_1 x (avg PE)

Iterate for some number of years, usually 5
So far, the steps to grab raw data is manual download from Morningstar
Copy the row/cols manually into a clean format.

Morningstar's api is no longer working. Change the approach to manual.
Changed the approach so far. Not doing regression on earnings anymore.
Instead, plot past data of 
   EPS        ROE
   PE_ratio   PB_ratio
   free cash flow per share (fcfps)
   dividend   numberofshares
   payout_ratio

This project is for implementing a stock analysis tool.

The book titled Buffetology by Mary Buffet describes an algorithm.
    1. Check if earnings predictable. Consistent or growing.
    2. Determine initial rate of return from the PE ratio
    3. Determine per share earnings growth rate
    4. Determine value of company relative to gov bonds
    5. Determine the best/worst cases stock price using historical PE
    6. Determine annual return compounding rate
    7. Is the company in serious debt? ( LTDebt + STDebt ) / Equity
    
We will do regression on total earnings & EPS. Will predict earnings 10Y from now
