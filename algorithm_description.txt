This stock screener library is for quickly plotting the performance of a company across time.
If you observe that it is somewhat stable and 'predictable', you can try to extrapolate future results.

The core of this work revolves around the concept of ROE, return-on-equity.
I think it generally works well, except in cases of extreme leverage.
It also breaks down in companies with negative book value.

Here's the algorithm in English.
1. Plot the company's most important past data.
        earnings per share (EPS) 
        free cash flow per share (FCFPS)
        dividend per share
    Take a visual look. Is it stable or increasing? If too violent, chuck aside.
2. Plot the company's return-on-equity (ROE). Is it increasing over time or stable? 
   In the same plot, take a look at the payout ratio. Is the dividend sustainable?
3. Plot the book value of the company and the stock price to get a sense of long term performance.
4. Take a look at the share count. Is it increasing dramatically (indicating dilution)?
5. In the future, there should be a look at the debt to equity ratios. This isn't done yet
6. Once all those numbers are in, we take an estimate of the company's future prospects. 

Let's say the managers are the same, some what decent. The ROE remains the same. 
If you use this assumption, you can estimate the ROE from its average. 
With an average ROE, you start the prediction algorithm. 

In year 0, the company has book value of BV_0.
In year 1, the company should make an EPS of ROE_avg x BV_0. 
Some of it is paid out as dividends.

The calculations should thus be
EPS_1 = (ROE_avg x BV_0)            {This is earnings per share in year 1}
DIV_1 = (EPS_1 x payoutratio)       {This is dividends per share}
BV_1  = BV_0 + EPS_1 - DIV_1        {This is the book value for year 1 end}
Stkprice_1 = EPS_1 x (PE_average)   {Estimate stock price from EPS & avg PE}

Keep looping this process for however number of years you need. 
Let's say we predict 5 years of data.
Once you have this whole set of predictions, you can start to do DCF analysis.

In the next 5 years, I know I will get a cash flow of
Cashflow = DIV_1, DIV_2, DIV_3, DIV_4, DIV_5 (need to subtract div tax rates when calculating CF)
In year 5, I also sell my stock
Cashflow = DIV_1, DIV_2, DIV_3, DIV_4, DIV_5 + estimated stk price

So plug in a DCF calculator of what discount rate you want, with the cashflow. 
You can then see the present value of the stock in question. 
If the present value is significantly higher than the market price, you may have found a gem.

WARNING:
This algorithm doesn't work well in cases where companies are extremely leveraged.
When the ROE number becomes too high or negative, it becomes not very meaningful.
Case in point, Boeing in 2019 has a negative book value because of share buybacks.

The ROE is ill defined in this case. Not really applicable anymore.

ROE is like a speed limit on the company. 
If every piece of earnings was reinvested, the company cannot grow faster than that.
Not without changing its fundamental operations or taking on more debt.

===============================================================================
Mary Buffett's descriptions of this algorithm
1. Are earnings predictable? Consistent or growing?
    Visual observation
    
2. Determine initial rate of return. 
    (1/PE)
    
3. Determine per share earnings growth rate. 
    Calculate from ROE, reinvestment, div payout_ratio
    
4. Determine value of company relative to gov bonds    
    Plugging in DCF

5. Determine the best/worst cases stock price using historical PE
    Grab PE stats

6. Is the company in serious debt? 
    ( LTDebt + STDebt ) / Equity
